         <li>1942-Receives a Ph.D. from Princeton University, working under John Archibald Wheeler</li>
         <li>1943-Joins the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos to work on the development of the atomic bomb </li>
         <li>1945-Witnesses the first detonation of an atomic bomb in the Trinity test </li>
         <li>1945 - Marries his first wife, Arline Greenbaum, who dies later that year </li>
         <li>1947 - Begins teaching theoretical physics at Cornell University </li>
         <li>1950 - Moves to Caltech (California Institute of Technology) to work as a professor of theoretical physics </li>
         <li>1959 - Delivers his famous lecture, "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom," which discusses the potential of nanotechnology </li>
         <li>1961 - Publishes "Quantum Electrodynamics," which becomes a cornerstone in the field </li>
         <li>1965 - Receives the Nobel Prize in Physics, along with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, for their work in quantum electrodynamics </li>
         <li>1965 - Publishes "The Feynman Lectures on Physics," which becomes a highly influential series of physics textbooks</li>
         <li>1986 - Serves on the Rogers Commission to investigate the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, famously demonstrating the effect of cold on the shuttle's O-rings with a simple experiment</li>
         <li>1988 - Dies of abdominal cancer at the age of 69 (nice)</li>
